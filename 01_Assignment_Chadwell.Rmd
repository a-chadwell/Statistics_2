## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```



# Load packages

Echo=FALSE

library(tidyverse) # To use dplyr functions and the pipe operator when needed
library(ggplot2) # To visualize data (this package is also loaded by library(tidyverse))
library(ggdag) # To create our DAGs



```{r}

#Naive Average Treatment Effect
NATE <- 95-88

NATE = 7

#Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

#ATE=E(Y1i)−E(Y0i)

ATE <- .5*2- (1-.5)*4

ATE = -1


#Average Treatment Effect on the treated (ATT)

ATT <- 95-93

ATT = 2

#Average Treatment Effect on the control 

ATC <- 92-88

ATC = 4


#Selection/Baseline bias 

#E[Y0|D=1]- E[Y0|D=0]

SB<- 93-88

SB= 5

#Heterogeneous Treatment Effect 

#(1-π)(ATT-ATC)

HTE <- (1-.5)*(2-4)

HTE = -1

```
